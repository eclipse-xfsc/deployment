# Purpose

This repository is **solely** used to store the configuration for ArgoCD and Kubernetes Operators used in the four available Kubernetes clusters provided by eco (train1, train2, train3, train4)

We decided to have the configuration based in a public git repository, in case some changes in the future are required.

This repository contains **no** relevant code for the Train development, setup or distribution to third parties, and is out of the scope of the TRAIN specification.
